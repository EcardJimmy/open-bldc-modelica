==================

Multi physics simulation models for open-bldc.

## Project description

Open-bldc-modelica is an open-source Modelica project for the physical simulation of brushless dc motors and controllers. The simulation models are concurrently developed with a motor controller [hardware](https://github.com/joewa/open-bldc-hardware/tree/master/strip/v0.2) and [software](https://github.com/joewa/bldc-strip) and are used to understand and test the control algorithms before/while they are implemented to the real controller software and hardware.
